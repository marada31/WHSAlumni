                      the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy 
                      Policy") to explain what information may be collected on 
                      our Website, how we use this information, and under what 
                      circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

                    <p align="left">Like 
                      most website operators, Worthington High School Alumni Club 
                      collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort 
                      that web browsers and servers typically make available, 
                      such as the browser type, language preference, referring 
                      site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Worthington 
                      High School Alumni Club's purpose in collecting non-personally 
                      identifying information is to better understand how Worthington 
                      High School Alumni Club's visitors use its website. From 
                      time to time, Worthington High School Alumni Club may release 
                      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, 
                      e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its 
                      website. This is generally used for troubleshooting issues 
                      through our server hosts at GoDaddy.com.</p>
                    <p align="left">Worthington 
                      High School Alumni Club also collects potentially personally-identifying 
                      information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged 
                      in users. Worthington High School Alumni Club only discloses 
                      logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same 
                      circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying 
                      information as described below.</p>
                    <h6 align="left">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h6>
                    <p align="left">Certain 
                      visitors to Worthington High School Alumni Club's Website 
                      choose to interact with Worthington High School Alumni Club 
                      in ways that require Worthington High School Alumni Club 
                      to gather personally-identifying information. The amount 
                      and type of information that Worthington High School Alumni 
                      Club gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For 
                      example, we ask visitors who sign up to receive notification 
                      email at http://www.worthingtonhighschoolalumniclub.com 
                      to provide a alumnus name and email address, and class year 
                      of graduation. This is directly emailed to a club executive 
                      board member for the purposes of being notified of alumni 
                      events in the Worthington, Ohio area. This information once 
                      received is not available in online electronic form to the 
                      public and is for sole use of notifying alumni events. At 
                      times other information will be in our Guest Book where 
                      users can leave comments without gathering more than a name 
                      and class year. No other personal information is gathered 
                      there for our Website use but is also at a third party at 
                      that posting.</p>
